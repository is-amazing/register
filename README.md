## About

We are a group of people who want to help developers have a platform to showcase their projects and websites, while being absolutely 100% free at the same time. Our goal is to allow developers have a place to showcase their talents and skills while also giving others a way to access and view their work. We offer a free subdomain on is-amaz.ing, like `foo.is-amaz.ingl` or `bar.is-amaz.ing` for your sites with the [CNAME record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record).


## Registration

If your file does not follow the required template, your pull request will **NOT** be merged. After reading the template, you can add your json file under the domains folder, and then create a pull request.
4. Send your pull request, and your request will be reviewed and if the requirements are met, will be merged. Do keep an eye on it!~
